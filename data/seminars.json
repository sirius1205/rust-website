    "description": "Michal Swietek, Co-founder of Aleph will be presenting Aleph, the first asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol that achieves asymptotically optimal performance: constant latency and communication complexity. The goal of this seminar is to give a bird’s eye view of Aleph, its implementation in Rust and our experience in integrating it as a finality gadget in Substrate (replacing GRANDPA with Aleph). The differences between Aleph and GRANDPA will be discussed, including performance benchmarks and some tradeoffs."
