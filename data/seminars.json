    "description": "In this seminar, Parity Developer Advocate Sacha Lansky will walk through some of Substrate’s key concepts by diving into some intermediate level how-to guides. In doing so, he plans to showcase different implementations of certain concepts and their APIs, with a focus on how to write pallets that are customized for a particular use case. Topics will include: pallet coupling, origins and runtime configurations."

    "description": "Michal Swietek, Co-founder of Aleph will be presenting Aleph, the first asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol that achieves asymptotically optimal performance: constant latency and communication complexity. The goal of this seminar is to give a bird’s eye view of Aleph, its implementation in Rust and our experience in integrating it as a finality gadget in Substrate (replacing GRANDPA with Aleph). The differences between Aleph and GRANDPA will be discussed, including performance benchmarks and some tradeoffs."

In this workshop, you will learn how to leverage Fat Contract’s unique features like asynchronous HTTP request and computation-intensive tasks in ink! language."
