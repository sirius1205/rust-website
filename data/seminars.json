    "description": "In this seminar, Parity Developer Advocate Sacha Lansky will walk through some of Substrate’s key concepts by diving into some intermediate level how-to guides. In doing so, he plans to showcase different implementations of certain concepts and their APIs, with a focus on how to write pallets that are customized for a particular use case. Topics will include: pallet coupling, origins and runtime configurations."

    "description": "Michal Swietek, Co-founder of Aleph will be presenting Aleph: the first asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol that achieves asymptotically optimal performance: constant latency and communication complexity. The goal of this talk is to give a bird’s eye view of Aleph, it’s implementation in Rust and our experience in integrating it as a finality gadget in Substrate (replacing GRANDPA with Aleph). The differences between Aleph and GRANDPA will be discussed, including performance benchmarks and some tradeoffs."
