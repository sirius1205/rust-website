          Mangata is a highly performant cross-chain DEX that aims for the best trading experience. By re-architecturing
          the blockchain principles, Mangata has no gas costs and a guarantee of transaction success. Frontrunning
          practices are prevented on all levels - no mempool frontrunning and no miner reordering.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is enabled by the custom consensus that prevents MEV and all network participants are equal. Buy & burn
          mechanism ensures the automatic demand for native token, that is as well distributed to treasury. This in
          combination with bridge to Ethereum ensures flow of liquidity to Polkadot ecosystem and a convenient trading
          interface for everyone.

        <h4>What challenges is the project focusing and what problems is it trying to solve?</h4>
        <p>
          On most of the major level 1 (L1) platforms, native tokens are required to pay for transaction fees. This is a
          major hurdle for newcomers to decentralized finance (DeFi). For example, they may want to convert fiat to
          stablecoins and use them to participate in DeFi protocols. But they may also need to purchase the native
          tokens of the DeFi platform they are using in order to be able to actually use their stablecoins. This
          requires a lot more work and brings them unwanted exposure to the crypto market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oracle is a very important component in many DeFi protocols. Oracle operators fetch external data and feed
          them back to the blockchain. However, there are few major issues with existing oracle solutions on current
          major DeFi platforms. Firstly, oracle feed transactions are beneficial to the platform, but those transactions
          are still subject to a transaction fee. This significantly increases the cost of using oracles and requires
          additional incentives to cover the cost. Secondly, oracle transactions are usually in the same category as
          other transactions in terms of priority. This means when the network is congested, those security-critical
          transactions have to compete with other user transactions and may not be included in the block in a timely
          manner, resulting in damage to the protocols. Similarly, oracle feed transactions can also be arbitrarily
          reordered by block producers and can increase MEV (miner extractable value) and other attack vectors like
          Sandwich attacks..
        </p>
        <p>
          Many existing DeFi protocols are implemented in Solidity, which has a large developer community. This imposes
          a challenge to any DeFi platforms that do not support EVM & Solidity as a lot of effort is required to onboard
          developers and existing EVM & Solidity tools and libraries cannot be reused .

            Solution
          </h2>
        </div>
        <h4>How did the specific USPs of Substrate solve the challenges faced?</h4>
        <p>
          Substrate is very flexible. That allows customizing almost everything, including fee payment logic. Acala
          built a custom transaction payment pallet that integrates with their DEX pallet for transaction fee handling.
          This means users can pay fees with any tokens listed in the Acala DEX without holding any native tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Substrate allows customizing transaction pools and marking certain transactions as operational,
          with a higher priority over other transactions. This means Acala can ensure that oracle feed transactions are
          always highest priority; they are always included at the beginning of the block and therefore avoid the
          problem of block producers arbitrarily reordering the transactions. Valid oracle feed transactions were also
          made feeless to reduce the cost of oracle operators. With all those features combined, Acala will be able to
          have more oracle operators, have the feed transactions included even when the network is congested, and reduce
          MEV. As a result, the protocols on Acala will be more secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Substrate also provides an EVM pallet that allows Acala to support EVM & Solidity smart contracts. This means
          that existing Solidity smart contracts can be ported to the Acala platform with minimal changes, and Solidity
          developers can develop DeFi applications on Acala with familiar tools and libraries. At the same time, they
          can still customize the Acala EVM to include new features that are not available on other EVM platforms. This
          will allow Solidity smart contracts to also leverage all the advanced features of Acala as well as the
          multi-chain ecosystem of Polkadot.
