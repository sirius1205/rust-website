Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama hackathons are a key part of the developer ecosystem. Online meetups with prizes of up to $60,000 have taken place throughout 2020 and 2021, allowing the community to build blockchains, make connections and share ideas.

Hackathons are the ideal way to learn by doing with Substrate and Polkadot. Getting hands-on experience with the tools and frameworks used within the ecosystem enables our community to push the boundaries of both their own projects, and the Substrate technology itself.

Think of hackathons as mini incubators too â€” these events bring together developers from all over the world to connect and provide one another with new ideas and perspectives that generate new collaborative potential.

Our hackathons will continue being a cornerstone of Substrate innovation and community engagement. We encourage you to find the next session and sign up here.
