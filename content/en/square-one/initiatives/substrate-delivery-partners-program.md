Substrate teams have access to a rich ecosystem of motivated third-parties interested in taking services from the community. This open marketplace for Substrate teams to connect with external companies helps ensure that the innovative work being created using Substrate translates into viable business models and new partnerships.

What can a Delivery Partner do for me? Delivery Partners are split into two categories:

 - Tier one: Well-scaled, dependable teams with a lot of experience
 - Tier two: Newer teams using the Substrate stack

Think of Delivery Partners as a resource to help develop and expand your Substrate project. Whether you’re an early stage team with funding but no solid tech, or a team who has developed an idea but not quite to a PoC level, Partners’ experience and networking value across the Substrate community can provide practical ways to develop your ideas.

How can I be introduced to a Delivery Partner?

A member of Parity’s ecosystem development team will connect Delivery Partners directly with interested parties.
