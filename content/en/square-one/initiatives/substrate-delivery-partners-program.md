###### What can a Delivery Partner do for me?

Think of Delivery Partners as a resource to help develop and expand your Substrate project. Whether you’re an early stage team with funding but no solid tech, or a team who has developed an idea but not quite to a PoC level, Partners’ experience and networking value across the Substrate community can provide practical ways to develop your ideas.
