Polkadot is built on the strength of its community. Becoming deeply integrated into that community is the ideal way to help shape its direction, share knowledge and expertise, and act as one of its voices.

This is why the Polkadot Ambassador program was created. A network of dedicated Polkadot users, enthusiasts and evangelists works to build and strengthen a global presence for the ecosystem. 

Who can be an Ambassador?

There is no set criteria for being an Ambassador — it is open to everyone who wants to contribute to the growth of the Polkadot vision and ecosystem. Whether you’re a developer or a non-technical enthusiast, the program enables you to work collaboratively to write the next chapter of Web3.

Currently, the program is spread across six core topics:

 - Advocacy
 - Community moderation
 - Content
 - Developers
 - Events
 - Localization 

What does being an Ambassador involve?

New inductees benefit from an introduction phase to learn how the community works, as well as getting the opportunity to showcase work and ideas, and meet other ambassadors. 

The next stage is to strengthen the Polkadot vision worldwide. Practically, this could involve being active in your local developer or general technology communities to spread awareness about Polkadot. For example, you could participate in events, or even organize your own, to introduce new users to development in the Polkadot ecosystem.

What is the goal?

The ambition for the Polkadot Ambassador program is extremely wide. One of the primary aims is to expand the footprint of Polkadot in different geographies through word of mouth, engaging content, and participating in events.
