Teams building parachains using Substrate have the opportunity to build their communities and extend their projects into a Gold Standard Ecosystem. This is the Builders for Builders initiative.

If you’re a team that has built a Parachain with dApp functionality, the Builders for Builders initiative has been designed to help extend your project into a Gold Standard Ecosystem.

Who can apply?

Any team that has built a parachain with Daap functionality can apply to join the Builders for Builders initiative. However, the process will vary depending on whether your team went through the Substrate Builders Program previously.

In such cases, Committee Members can vote to accept, reject, or postpone a team, and feedback will be delivered to the team in question accordingly.

For teams who have not participated in the Substrate Builders Program: A series of technical and business reviews will be carried out to assess a team’s suitability for the initiative. business reviews will be carried out to assess a team’s suitability for the initiative.
