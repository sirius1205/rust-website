[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f86ac67b-b1aa-41a7-95ec-3a2d14cb3bad/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/substrate-website/deploys)

## Content contribution, PRs and merging flow

- PR providing content (`json`, `md`...): open PR against `main` branch (production)
- PR providing new features: open PR against `develop` branch
- PR providing `hotfixes` open only against `main` (fixes will be merged into `develop` with next features)

**Deploying new features**

- `develop` <- `main`: update content and fixes
- `develop` <- `feature/branch`: merging feature PRs
- `main` <- `develop`: deploying new release to production

## Development

### Install

Navigate into your cloned local repo directory and install all dependencies.

```shell
yarn
```

**Configure environment variables**

Copy `example.env.development` and rename to `.env.development`

Config URL variables based on your preferable local setup. URL will be used for links generation between documentation and platform stack

- `GATSBY_WEBSITE_URL`: represents this project (Substrate website)
- `GATSBY_DOCS_URL` represents project serving documentation

```
GATSBY_WEBSITE_URL=http://localhost:8000
GATSBY_DOCS_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

**Start development server**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and use the following command to start the development server locally.

```shell
yarn develop
```

## Setup, configuration & plugins

### i18n (currently not in use)

Docs:

- https://github.com/microapps/gatsby-plugin-react-i18next#how-to-extract-translations-from-pages
- https://www.i18next.com
- https://react.i18next.com

#### Configuration

You can find the config for i18n, using i18next with `gatsby-plugin-react-i18next`.

- the markdown content is located in `./content/{language}/{content_type}/*`/
- the language strings are located in `./locales/{language}/{data_type}.json`

The default language (and fallback language) is `en` for english.

#### Extract strings

To extract the strings that needs to be translated, it is possible to run `yarn extract-locales`, which will generate the `/locales-tmp` folder.

### netlify-cms (currently not in use)

`netlify-cms-app` & `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` are used to setup `[netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org)` for this project.

The gatsby gatsby-config pluggin, points to the file `src/cms/index.js`, as entry file of the configuration.

#### local git-gateway backend

To develop and use netlify-cms with the data available in the local repository folder:

In the file `./.env.development` set:

```
GATSBY_NETLIFY_CMS_GIT_LOCAL=true
```

Then in the project's root folder run:

```
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```

and in an other shell and the same folder, run the development server as usual.
